## How to Run our Websites:
Click the ```index.html```

**It is better to use the Chrome as a main browser**



## Notes:
1. We only show the layout of our user data on the user page, the specific information is not real and interactable.
2. The specific use of the **"watchlist"** function is only available on the **home page** (the categories page doesn't have time to provide options, but we think we've demonstrated the feasibility of this functionality on home page).
3. We only created three movie specific pages for the movies, the rest are fake pages.
4. The heart button is fake on the movie page, it can only change the status but cannot add the movie to the watchlist. 
5. The watchlist button under the categories dropdown menu in the top bar doesn't do anything.
